NAT
    Is this a legitimate concern?
    What do we need to figure out?
Desync
    How to deal with it?
    Key: prevention!
    worst case scenario: send a copy of gamestate?
        -Very expensive. Probably not worth it?
        Alternatively, send a list of commands?

Threading
    One thread per game?
    One process per game?

Peer-to-peer
    Pro:
        No need for server
            Lower overhead
        Lower latency?
    Con:
        NAT
            -Isn't this a problem regardless?
        Cheating
        Harder to pursue card trading model
